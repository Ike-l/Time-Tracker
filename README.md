# Python Productivity Tracker

## Description
This project is a productivity tracker that allows users to record and monitor the time they spend on various activities. It utilizes Python's sqlite3 module for data storage, and other built-in modules for additional functionalities. The tracker prompts the user for their current activity, keeps a timer running, and can provide summaries of time spent per day, week, or month.

## Installation
To run this productivity tracker, you'll need Python and a few Python libraries. First, install Python. After that, you can use pip to install the necessary libraries. Here are the installation commands for Unix-based systems:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.8
$ pip install pygame
```
For Windows systems, you can download Python from [the official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and use pip in a similar manner to install the necessary libraries.
Also, make sure you have a BellSound.mp3 file in the same directory as the script for the reminder sound. Alternatively replace the mp3 with another. Make sure the audio is longer than the wait between breaks

## Usage
Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal:
```bash
$ python main.py
```
Once the program is running, follow the prompts in the terminal to record your activity and view your productivity statistics.
